If you are interested in joining HPSF as a member, you can
[sign up in LFX](https://enrollment.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/?project=hpsf), Linux
Foundation's onboarding platform.

Projects will need to be approved by the TAC, which is currently being formed.

We are in the process of setting up mailing lists, but for now, for questions on either
membership or project onboarding, contact:

* {{<icon class="fa fa-envelope">}} Todd&nbsp;Gamblin&nbsp;[tgamblin@llnl.gov](mailto:tgamblin@llnl.gov) and
* {{<icon class="fa fa-envelope">}} Christian&nbsp;Trott&nbsp;[crtrott@sandia.gov](mailto:crtrott@sandia.gov).
